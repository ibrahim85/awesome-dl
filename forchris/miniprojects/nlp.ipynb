While the rest of this notebook will assume you are using a list of dictionaries, you can complete it with dataframes, if you so desire. Some of the example code will need to be modified in this case.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Building models\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first three questions, you will need to build and train an estimator to predict the star rating from the text of a review.  We recommend building a pipeline out of transformers and estimators provided by Scikit Learn.  You can decide whether these pipelines should take full review objects or just their text as input to the `fit()` and `predict()` methods, but it does pay to be consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find it useful to serialize the trained models to disk.  This will allow you to reload the models after restarting the notebook, without needing to retrain them.  We recommend using the [`dill` library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dill) for this (although the [`joblib` library](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html) also works).  Use\n",

    "dill.dump(estimator, open('estimator.dill', 'w'))\n",
    "```\n",

Instead of serializing the whole `GridSearchCV`, serialize just the estimator with the correct hyperparameters.  This can be accessed through the `.best_estimator_` attribute of the `GridSearchCV` object.  Alternatively, the `.best_params_` attribute gives the best values of the hyperparameters.\n",

If not, you will need to write a small wrapper function to mediate the data types.\n",

Use a [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer) or [HashingVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer) to produce a feature matrix giving the counts of each word in each review.  Feed this in to linear model, such as `Ridge` or `SGDRegressor`, to predict the number of stars from each review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "1. Don't forget to use tokenization!  This is important for good performance but it is also the most expensive step.  Try vectorizing as a first initial step and then running grid-serach and cross-validation only on of this pre-processed data.  `CountVectorizer` has to memorize the mapping between words and the index to which it is assigned.  This is linear in the size of the vocabulary.  The `HashingVectorizer` does not have to remember this mapping and will lead to much smaller models.\n",

    " # without needing to retrain the vectorizer:\n",
    " model.fit(X, stars, hyperparameter=something)\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try choosing different values for `min_df` (minimum document frequency cutoff) and `max_df` in `CountVectorizer`.  Setting `min_df` to zero admits rare words which might only appear once in the entire corpus.  This is both prone to overfitting and makes your data unmanageably large.  Don't forget to use cross-validation or to select the right value.  Notice that `HashingVectorizer` doesn't support `min_df`  and `max_df`.  However, it's not hard to roll your own transformer that solves for these.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try using [LinearRegression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression) or [RidgeCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV).  If the memory footprint is too big, try switching to [Stochastic Gradient Descent](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor) You might find that even ordinary linear regression fails due to the data size.  Don't forget to use [GridSearchCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) to determine the regularization parameter!  How do the regularization parameter `alpha` and the values of `min_df` and `max_df` from `CountVectorizer` change the answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will likely pick up several hyperparameters between the tokenization step and the regularization of the estimator.  While is is more strictly correct to do a grid search over all of them at once, this can take a long time. Quite often, doing a grid search over a single hyperparameter at a time can produce similar results.  Alternatively, the grid search may be done over a smaller subset of the data, as long as it is representative of the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, assemble a pipeline that will transform the data from records all the way to predictions.  This will allow you to submit its predict method to the grader for scoring."

Let's say you're training a model to extract image captions from websites and return a list of names that were in the caption. Your overall accuracy at some point reaches 70%. You can try manually giving the model what you know are the correct image captions from the training set, and see how the accuracy improves (maybe up to 75%). Alternatively, giving the model the perfect name parsing for each caption increases accuracy to 90%. This indicates that the name parsing is a much more promising target for further work, and the caption extraction is a relatively smaller factor in the overall performance.\n",

We can think of the corpus as defining an empirical distribution over all ngrams.  We can find word pairs that are unlikely to occur consecutively based on the underlying probability of their words. Mathematically, if $p(w)$ be the probability of a word $w$ and $p(w_1 w_2)$ is the probability of the bigram $w_1 w_2$, then we want to look at word pairs $w_1 w_2$ where the statistic\n",

The smoothing parameter chosen in the reference solution is equivalent to giving each word 90 previous appearances prior to considering this data.  This was chosen by generating a list of bigrams for a range of smoothing parameters and seeing how many of the bigrams were shared between neighboring values.  When the shared fraction reached 95%, we judged the solution to have converged.  Note that `min_df` should not be set too high, where it could exclude these borderline words."
